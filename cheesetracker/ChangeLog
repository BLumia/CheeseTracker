	* mutex_lock.h: New class, Mutex_Lock_Container, which locks a
	mutex during construction and unlocks it upon destruction.

	* sample_data.h/cpp (lock): Now returns pointer to
	Mutex_Lock_Container.
	* sample_data.h/cpp (unlock): Removed.
	* sample_data.h/cpp (seek): Now returns the final seek position.

	* tracker_voice.cpp (mix): Using sample_data mutexes.

	* tracker_voice.cpp (add_to_mix_buffer): Renamed several
	cryptically-named variables, corrected an OB1 bug in the
	loop-checking logic.

	Removed the 300-page dissertation on fixed-point numbers.

	* sample_data.cpp (resample functions): Commented out the checks
	for sample EOF, as I attempt to make tracker_voice stay
	perfectly within the boundaries.

	* resampler_instance.h/cpp (set_fractional): Removed.

	* : Removed all variables and class members named
	"fractional_size".

	* resampler_manager_new.cpp: Removed.

	* dds_helpers.cpp (get_effect_chain_data): Corrected "taking
	address of temporary" warning from G++ by creating new local
	variable "property_list".

	Also moved curly braces in function definitions to Column 1,
	so that ']]' works in vi.

	* loader_xm.cpp (loader_instrument_internal): Moved the
	sample.data.seek(0) call down to the part that loads the sample
	data from the disk.

Sun Jun 10 06:55:15 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* sample_data.cpp (fixedpoint_move_cursor): Removed the for-loop
	that was previously placed around the whole function. This
	for-loop was intended for a different design that never got
	implemented. Instead, it caused a bug.
