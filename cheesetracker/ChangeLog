	* sample_data.cpp: ASSERT_NOTFIXEDPOINT is defined to nothing
	if NDEBUG is defined.  * common/components/audio/fixedpoint.h:
	Created. The fixed-point functions from sample_data.h are
	defined here, and there are comments that explain how the whole
	fixed-point scheme works.

	Incidentally, another fixedpoint.h file was discovered,
	common/components/data/fixedpoint.h, which defines a fixed-point
	class for which there are no method definitions in the source.

Tue Jun 12 01:32:10 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* multireader_lock.h/cpp: Created. Any number of threads 
	can hold an multireader_lock, and any one process can lock
	all the others out. This allows many threads to read
	a memory region, and one thread to kick the others out
	for writing.

	* sample_data.h: Now uses a multireader_lock instead of
	a mutex.

Mon Jun 11 14:18:56 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* mutex_lock.h: New method on Mutex_Lock_Container: add().
	This makes it possible to put more than one mutex in the
	same Mutex_Lock_Container, all of which will be released
	together.

Mon Jun 11 10:16:54 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* mutex_lock.h: New class, Mutex_Lock_Container, which locks a
	mutex during construction and unlocks it upon destruction.

	* sample_data.h/cpp (lock): Now returns pointer to
	Mutex_Lock_Container.
	* sample_data.h/cpp (unlock): Removed.
	* sample_data.h/cpp (seek): Now returns the final seek position.

	* tracker_voice.cpp (mix): Using sample_data mutexes.

	* tracker_voice.cpp (add_to_mix_buffer): Renamed several
	cryptically-named variables, corrected an OB1 bug in the
	loop-checking logic.

	Removed the 300-page dissertation on fixed-point numbers.

	* sample_data.cpp (resample functions): Commented out the checks
	for sample EOF, as I attempt to make tracker_voice stay
	perfectly within the boundaries.

	* resampler_instance.h/cpp (set_fractional): Removed.

	* : Removed all variables and class members named
	"fractional_size".

Sun Jun 10 13:50:36 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* resampler_manager_new.cpp: Removed.

	* dds_helpers.cpp (get_effect_chain_data): Corrected "taking
	address of temporary" warning from G++ by creating new local
	variable "property_list".

	Also moved curly braces in function definitions to Column 1,
	so that ']]' works in vi.

Sun Jun 10 13:41:59 EDT 2007 J Phelps 
	* loader_xm.cpp (loader_instrument_internal): Moved the
	sample.data.seek(0) call down to the part that loads the sample
	data from the disk.

Sun Jun 10 06:55:15 EDT 2007 J Phelps <godless@users.sf.net>
	* sample_data.cpp (fixedpoint_move_cursor): Removed the for-loop
	that was previously placed around the whole function. This
	for-loop was intended for a different design that never got
	implemented. Instead, it caused a bug.
