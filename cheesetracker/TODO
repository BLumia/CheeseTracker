	Stereo sample support is still missing! Theoretically, the mixer now supports it,
	and so do the loaders for many of the file formats. However, the saver for the
	CheeseTracker module format does NOT support stereo samples, and requires extensive
	modification (perhaps even more extensive than what the mixer needed) to achieve
	the desired functionality. 

	It may even be necessary to design a whole new CheeseTracker format.

	The data structure that represents samples in CheeseTracker is still mono only,
	despite having an interface that would lead one to believe that it supports
	many channels. For performance reasons, this interface may need to be changed. The
	interface suggests that there should be a separate stream for each channel.
	If this is how it's actually implemented, it will run more slowly than if
	the channels are interleaved, as is traditionally done.

	Interleaving the channels removes the possibility of the channels having different
	lengths, and also removes the possibility of iterating through them separately.

	The handlers for CheeseTracker format (both loading and saving) use an insidious
	monstrosity called a "dynamic data structure", whose sole purpose is to completely
	bypass the C++ type system. This is just evil.

	CheeseTracker will eventually begin loading its samples with libaudiofile, which
	will increase the number of supported sample formats.

	CheeseTracker will eventually support both OGG and FLAC formats, both as sample
	types, and as song output formats.
